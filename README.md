# Incubation of vNext 'media-source' Specification Features

This is [the repository forked off the W3C REC repository for
media-source](https://github.com/w3c/media-source), and is intended to track
incubation of new media-source features.

You're welcome to contribute! Let's continue to make the Web rock our socks off!

The admins will update this repository's gh-pages branch to align with
the upstream w3c repository.

**All** specification updates that are part of incubation will be done on a
per-feature branch off of gh-pages in this repository. Please base your
pull-requests accordingly.

We will use the upstream w3c/media-source repository's issue tracker for feature
discussion beyond pull-requests.

The following is the list of current feature incubation branches:

* [codec-switching](https://github.com/WICG/media-source/tree/codec-switching)
  * Tracking issue:
    [w3c/media-source/issues/155](https://github.com/w3c/media-source/issues/155)
