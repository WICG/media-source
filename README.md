# Incubation of vNext 'media-source' Specification Features


# May 2021: See instead the upstream w3c media-source repository now for new feature incubations (this WICG repo was useful before MSE v2 work upstream began; current work is upstream). Moving incubated feature explainers, etc into the main spec is being done there currently (work-in-progress).


This is [the repository forked off the W3C REC repository for
media-source](https://github.com/w3c/media-source), and is intended to track
incubation of new media-source features.

You're welcome to contribute! Let's continue to make the Web rock our socks off!

The admins will update this repository's gh-pages branch to align with
the upstream w3c repository.

**All** specification updates that are part of incubation will be done on a
per-feature branch off of gh-pages in this repository. Please base your
pull-requests accordingly.

We will use the [upstream w3c/media-source repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/media-source/issues)
for feature discussion beyond pull-requests.
